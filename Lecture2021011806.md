# Coding Style

## Programing like an artist

### Why coding style matters

Since the first time we wrote our own codes on the computer, we have encountered  a new relationship with our readers, the first of whom is ourself. Sometimes we may find our previous codes can be reused in our current project. When we open our old codes and see something like this:

```c++
int*a=new int[10];
fun(a);
if(!b){
    seq(0,9,a);}
else return 0;
```

It seems confusing. Without any comments or readable variable names, codes can be dreadful especially when over hundreds lines. Nevertheless, after some revision, we can come up with what the alphabets mean in our codes.

Moreover, there's deeper problem underlying this kind of codes. That is Broken Windows Theory. A part of unpleasant codes make the followers unpleasant too.

However, the problem comes more serious when different people work together on a same project. Each of the programmers are too busy to look through another's codes. Most of the time, they just work with another's interfaces, in which case comments and readability count.

Naming is not the only one but the most prominent part of coding style, which varying among different organizations and companies. In the following parts, we're going to glimpse into some naming methods and some examples of specific coding styles for companies.

### Naming methods

To make variable names more readable, first we should use several words to describe the feature of the variable, which ought to be distinct. Thus another problem comes along. The name of the variables is too long, which in turn brings up two more issues. First is the complexity to type the name. The other is the difficulty to distinguish different words.

With the development of different IDEs , the association function solved the first problem quite well. For the other, some great naming conventions come to our aid.

#### Conventions

The “**camel case**” is the practice of writing sentences so that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the sentence begins with a capital letter, without spaces or punctuation. While "__Pascal case__" makes all words include the first begin with a capital letter.

As alternatives, there  are other conventions using "_" to separate words, like the following form.

| Name             | Alternative name                                | Format           |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Lower camel case | Camel case, Dromedary case                      | lowerCamelCase   |
| Upper camel case | Pascal case, Studly case                        | UpperCamelCase   |
| Upper snake case | Screaming snake case, Macro case, Constant case | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE |
| Lower snake case | Pothole case                                    | lower_snake_case |
| Upper kebab case | Screaming kebab case, Train case, COBOL case    | UPPER-KEBAB-CASE |
| Lower kebab case | Chain case, Dash case, Lisp case                | lower-kebab-case |

Another convention not included in the preceding form is "__Hungarian Notation__". This notation adds a prefix representing the type of the variable. 

| 属性 |                       |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| g_   | global variable       |
| c_   | constant variable     |
| m_   | class member variable |
| s_   | static variable       |

| Prefix       | Type      | Example        |
| :----------- | :-------- | :------------- |
| b            | boolean   | bLightsEnabled |
| c            | character | cLetterGrade   |
| str          | string    | strCategory    |
| i            | integer   | iWheels        |
| f            | float     | fMiles         |
| C            | class     | CPerson        |
| {class name} | object    | personLeader   |

For example:

```c++
char cletter;//c represents char
Button butPushMe;
```

However, with the IDEs nowadays, we can know the type of a variable easily by putting the mouse over the variable. So this notation is losing its popularity.

### Code Performance

This part is mainly about efficiency.

#### Hard Coding

Apart from the preceding coding style focusing on the external beauty, coding style also involve internal logic manner. Hard coding often uses specific statistics in the function body, which requires a program’s source code to be changed when an external data source has changed. In the example below we can have a glimpse.

```c++
return yuan*3.14;
```

Instead of specific statistics, we' d better use a const variable or a macro definition, which can be changed easily regardless of how many times it is used.  

```c++
const int pai=3.14;
```

### Specific Coding Style

The most famous coding style is Google C++ Style, which can be referred to in [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). In China, companies also set up their own standards, such as Huawei.

Here's part of a comparison form of the two style.

| 子项     | 华为                                                       | 谷歌                                                         |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 常量命名 | 局部const 变量小驼峰；全局const变量大写。                  | 命名时以 “k” 开头, 大小写混合使用; 如const int kDaysInAWeek = 7; |
| 函数命名 | 动宾结构；大驼峰；                                         | 常规函数使用大小写混合, 取值和设值函数则要求与变量名匹配: `MyExcitingFunction()`, `my_exciting_member_variable()`, `set_my_exciting_member_variable()` |
| 变量命名 | 以小驼峰为基础，三种风格：fileName, m_fileName, fileName_; | 变量、成员变量小写，成员变量以下划线结尾:file_name, file_name_ |

Though there are all kinds of coding style, it's ok for us to choose a readable one as our own style before we are in a team. When we cooperate with others, we' d better unify our coding styles before we start our work.

In a word, "__When in Rome, do as the Romans do.__"
